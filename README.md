## Description

Simple Game of Life is one of my practice projects to follow the TDD method and gain experience with new technologies myself. This web app is built with `React` + `Typescript` + `Jest` + `Vite`.

In this game, the player can adjust the layout of the board, default life cell, and iteration time. When clicking on Start, the game will begin.

[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It follows four simple rules.

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
